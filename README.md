Inspired by [KalleHallden](https://github.com/KalleHallden)'s [project](https://github.com/KalleHallden/ProjectInitializationAutomation) to automate the creation and deletion of a new github repo.

This project creates/deletes a folder on your local machine (organized by language) and initializes/removes it as a GitHub repo.

### Install: 
```zsh
git clone https://github.com/derekbunch/CreateGitHub.git
cd CreateGitHub
pip install -r requirements.txt
. ./github
```

### Usage:
```zsh
To run the script type in 'github <name of your project> <language> <Option>'

Options:
-c: Create
-d: Delete
```
